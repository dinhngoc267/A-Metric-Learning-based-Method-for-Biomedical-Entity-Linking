# A Metric Learning-based Method for Biomedical Entity Linking

The code for paper [A metric learning-based method for biomedical entity linking](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frma.2023.1247094/full).

We proposed a simple method that tackles the imbalance data issue and reduces significantly training and inference cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive linking performance compared to other SOTA methods.
